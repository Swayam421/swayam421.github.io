In this work, we extend instance-level semantic mapping to 3D. Using foundational models for object recognition, segmentation, and feature extraction, it creates a 3D point cloud with instance-level embeddings that enable language-guided navigation and object queries. The method improves both quantitative task success rates and qualitative instance identification, outperforming closed-set approaches in recognizing unseen objects.
